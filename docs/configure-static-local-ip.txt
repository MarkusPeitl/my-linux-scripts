# Configure a static local ip to always reach device inside the network with the same ip #

Useful if there is a service running on the device and you want to connect to it
as a media server, nas or ssh into the device.

Go to router settings in browser:
http://192.168.0.1/

Look for DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) settings.
These settings decide what ip address is assigned to a connected host in the local nework.
Look for "address reservation":
- Enter MAC address (can be found out in linux with "ip link") (this can be sped up if you find a clients list in your router settings that displays the mac addresses) 
- Enter the IP address under which you want to reach your host (assigns host ip if device with mac (phsysical) address gets connected to the router)
- Enable address reservation entry
- Check everything worked (disconnect your host from LAN or WLAN -> reconnect to router again -> call "ifconfig" to check local ip)


Set up tunneling via VPS:
https://www.devdungeon.com/content/expose-local-port-over-remote-vps-ssh-remote-port-forwarding

Create a reverse tunnel over ssh (tunnel from remote host to local host)
```
ssh -R 2999:localhost:3344 hostname.com
```
- 2999: Port to open for listening to packets on remote machine
- localhost: ip in the local network to open/route the ssh connection to
- 3344: Port to open for listening to packets on the local target machine
- hostname.com: ip address or domain of the remote host from which to connect to this machine using ssh Protocol

Check open ports on server (ssh into it first)
```
netstat -ntl
```

To make the openend port publicly available the ssh server settings need to be changed
on the remote server  
"GatewayPorts yes"  
has to be added to /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
Then restart ssh server
sudo systemctl restart sshd

Now redo the ssh reverse tunnel and check the connection from the remote host ip (or domain)
to the local machine.

Example apache 2 server listening on 3344
-> Reverse tunnel command above
-> Open up myserverdomain.com:2999/index.html

Starting ssh tunnels from managing machine:
- Make sure to have ssh access from you managing machine to your target host machines (where the wantes service or server is located)
ssh -t targetsshhostalias "ssh -R 2900:localhost:3344"
